Tic Tac Toe
This is a simple website that plays a tic tac toe game. It's "multiplayer", but really I just play it with myself, because that's just... What I do.
I was new to JavaScript when I started, and still consider myself new to the language. For that reason, there's probably many many things I could have done better.
Maybe one day, I'll come back and improve it, maybe I'll just forget all about it and let it sit and gather dust. Who knows.
...Dear me, this is a very morbid readme. To end on a brighter note, please have a nice day, and don't forget to go outside and touch grass-
